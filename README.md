# Inventory-system_ArrayList-version


This program implements an inventory system, using an ArrayList, that contains three types of items:
fruits that are purchased from an orchard for resale. vegetables that are purchased from a farm for resale. preserves that are made by the produce stand themselves for sale.
The program runs with a menu that allows the user to add an item to inventory, display to the screen the inventory, buy an item and sell an item .
